# About
We are using the power of computers to analyze the market and create an optimal stock analysis model which is not only limited to technical but also fundamental analysis of stock data.

# Background
Stock analyses revolves in two essential domains: *Technical Analysis* and *Fundamental Analysis*  

Technical Analyses deals with hard data through performing statistical analysis and calculations on that data. 

Fundamental Analyses revolves around assessing things like a company's worth/value, but from the purview of this project, it focuses on information on a company and the way that infromation influences public opinion on the company, which contributes to investor confidence. 
Investor confidence is what truly manipulates the market, and it depends on how people receive and perceive infromation. 

# Idea - Synopsis
Since technical analysis has a more mathematical undertone to it, it lies primarily within the domain of *machine learning* where the technical functions that we use can be optimised. 

Fundamental analysis has to do more with information and the nature of information of a company, available to the general populace. Hence, we use *scapers* to retrieve information and *natural language processing* to parse that information and determine the overall perspective on the company in question, as the average human would perceive it.
