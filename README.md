Stock analyses revolves in two essential domains: *Technical Analysis* and *Fundamental Analysis*  

Technical Analyses deals with hard data through performing statistical analysis and calculations on that data. 

Fundamental Analyses revolves around assessing things like a company's worth/value, but from the purview of this project, it focuses on information on a company and the way that infromation influences public opinion on the company, which contributes to investor confidence. 
Investor confidence is what truly manipulates the market, and it depends on how people receive and perceive infromation.
